This is a little piece of code that for a given PID reports the available bytes in its stdin and stdout. Can be used to inspect pipe congestions.

You might have to run this program with appropriate user to be able to peek into PID's file descriptors.

Usage: fdinspect PID

Or you can invoke it in recurrent intervals.
